This patch does initial setup of an 1/r density profile with source at the x=y=z=0 corner of 
the box, w. constant temperature of 10^4K throughout the box. This is specifically done to run 
a 2d version of the analytic result for density front propagaton from photon pressure, from 
Wise et al 2012.
