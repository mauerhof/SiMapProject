 FFUN:  The net continuum is very intense.
 I will try to press on, but may have problems.


 CAUTION The incident radiation field is surprisingly intense.
 The dimensionless hydrogen ionization parameter is 2.29e+21.
 This is many orders of magnitude brighter than commonly seen.
 This seems unphysical - please check that the radiation field intensity has been properly set.
 YOU MAY BE MAKING A BIG MISTAKE!!
